### Nation's Report Card 2017

This notebook combines multiple tabs from the Nation's Report Card,
released every couple of years [here](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/landing).

My main goal in doing this was shoe-horning the data into a visualization
tool I had already built in JS, but the combined spreadsheets make the data
more accessible programatically.

Here's the story we did on
[CTMirror.org](https://ctmirror.org/2018/04/10/cts-performance-nations-report-card-doesnt-budge/).

The viz folders contain the code for the hastily-hacked-together
visualizations, so the code is deadline-quality.
